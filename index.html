<p>Kerala, also known as God's Own Country has been facing the toughest time in nearly a 100 years.</p>
<p>Over 373 people died within a fortnight, while at least 280,679 people were evacuated, mainly from Chengannur,Pandanad,Aranmula, Aluva, Chalakudy, Kuttanad and Pandalam. All 14 districts of the state were placed on high alert.According to the Kerala government, one-sixth of the total population of Kerala had been directly affected by the floods and related incidents.Thirty-five out of the forty-two dams within the state were opened for the first time in history. All five overflow gates of the Idukki Dam were opened at the same time, for the first time in 26 years.</p>

<p>A multi-agency rescue mission involving the Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Army, the National Disaster Response Force, and several others had commenced on a modest scale on August 9 before expanding over the next 10 days, with hundreds of aerial and boat search parties tackling head-on the worst natural calamity in the State’s recent history.</p>
<p>Since the start of the operations, the Navy, Air Force and the Coast Guard have together flown 513 rescue-cum-relief sorties, clocking over 677 hours of flying, and airlifting 1,173 people to safety. At the time of reporting, boat rescues by the Navy and the fishers had together saved 16,843 people from certain death. </p>

<p>A total of 10,28,000 people are housed in 3274 camps in the flood hit districts.Relief material, including provisions, water and fuel have started arriving at Kochi from different parts of the country.Schools, colleges and many other places were turned to relief camps where people stayed.</p>

<p>Kerala flood situation has worsened with incessant rains and adverse weather conditions throwing life out of gear in God’s own country.The public transport system collapsed in many parts of central Kerala and transport services in the state came to a grinding halt with the Kochi airport, metro, bus services, and Southern Railways suspending their operations in view of the current situation. A red alert was sounded in 14 districts of the state.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 40px">COULD WE HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO PREVENT IT?</h3>
<p>Rains</p>
<p>Lots of Rains</p>
<p>That's all it took for the state of Kerala to flood in neck-deep water, for massive landslides to lay waste to roads and homes and for hundreds to lose their lives.The floods didn’t discriminate between people and property.At last count, 357 people lost their lives, and the floods destroyed roughly 906,400 hectares worth of crops. The cost to the state and its people stands at a staggering Rs 19,512 crore.</p>
<p>Once the floods and fury recede, there are evidently many lessons for authorities to take away from this disaster.The next time such a disaster occurs, we have no excuse for not being better prepared.</p>
